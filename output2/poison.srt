1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:05,251
The biggest poison in us is regret.

2
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:19,661
I think there are a lot of people that have dreams and aspirations of things that they always wanted to do, but it wasn't the right time or they didn't have enough money or they didn't have enough experience.

3
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:21,503
It's never the right time.

4
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,105
You're never going to have the right experience.

5
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,546
And all of a sudden you wake up and you're 70.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,061
And you're like, God, I wish I could have done it.

7
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:36,065
It's what you don't do that screws with you later on.

8
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,007
I get one shot at this life.

9
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,028
This is it.

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,870
And I don't want to go through life being the 80% version of me.

11
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,594
I don't want to look back and be like 77 and be like, I didn't do that.

12
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:55,938
There's so much I want to do and I love life so much, I don't want to miss it.
