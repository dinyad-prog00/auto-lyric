1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:01,348
The biggest

2
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:02,068
poison in

3
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:04,570
us is

4
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,451
regret. I

5
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:07,852
think there

6
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:07,972
are a

7
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:08,313
lot of

8
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:10,173
people that

9
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:11,035
have dreams

10
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:12,836
and aspirations

11
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:13,217
of things

12
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:13,496
that they

13
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:14,276
always wanted

14
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:14,598
to do,

15
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:15,278
but it

16
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:15,718
wasn't the

17
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:16,318
right time

18
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:17,300
or they

19
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,660
didn't have

20
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,280
enough money

21
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:18,519
or they

22
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:18,760
didn't have

23
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,661
enough experience.

24
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:20,882
It's never

25
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:21,202
the right

26
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:22,522
time. You're

27
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:22,923
never going

28
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:23,143
to have

29
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:23,443
the right

30
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:24,945
experience. And

31
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:25,286
all of

32
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:25,666
a sudden

33
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,065
you wake

34
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:26,365
up and

35
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:29,239
you're And

36
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,600
you're like,

37
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,161
God, I

38
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:30,460
wish I

39
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:30,740
could have

40
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,060
done it.

41
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:32,722
It's what

42
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:33,182
you don't

43
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,383
do that

44
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:35,363
screws with

45
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:35,804
you later

46
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:37,566
on. I

47
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:38,146
get one

48
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:38,545
shot at

49
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,006
this life.

50
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:40,968
This is

51
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:42,429
it. And

52
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:42,789
I don't

53
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:43,009
want to

54
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:43,289
go through

55
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:43,710
life being

56
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,609
the version

57
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:44,869
of me.

58
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,151
I don't

59
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,310
want to

60
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:46,692
look back

61
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:46,991
and be

62
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:47,551
like and

63
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:48,152
be like,

64
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:49,232
I didn't

65
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:49,594
do that.

66
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:51,575
There's so

67
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:51,895
much I

68
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:52,174
want to

69
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:52,655
do and

70
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:53,356
I love

71
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:54,076
life so

72
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,017
much, I

73
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:55,537
don't want

74
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:55,838
to miss

75
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:55,938
it.
